\details{
Different types to of boundaries available:
\itemize{
\item Unsimplified - High Precision Single Country Unstadardized. The premier geoBoundaries release,
representing the highest precision files available for every country in the world.
No standardization is performed on these files, so (for example) two countries
may overlap in the case of contested boundaries.
\item Simplified - Simplified Single Country Unstandardized. A simplified version of every file
available for every country in the world. No standardization is performed on these files,
so (for example) two countries may overlap in the case of contested boundaries.
